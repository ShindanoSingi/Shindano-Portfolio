                                        Created an application that enabled users to chat in real time. The goal of the project was to let users chat in privacy. Implemented user sign- up, sign In; room Creation, Update, and Deletion (CRUD). Also, users were able to delete messages. Used SQL, relational database to store usersâ€™data. The following technologies were used: Django and SQL for the back end and templates, JavaScript, Vanilla CSS, Materialize, Bootstrap, and TailWindCSS were utilized for the front end. Did project documentation in README.
